Snake, Water, Gun Game (Python):

This is a Python command-line game based on the classic Snake, Water, Gun concept (similar to Rock, Paper, Scissors).
The game is played between the user and the computer, where the computer makes a random choice and the winner is decided based on predefined rules.

This project was created while learning Python from the CodeWithHarry YouTube course.

*Game Rules:

Snake drinks Water → Snake wins

Water disables Gun → Water wins

Gun kills Snake → Gun wins

Same choice → Tie

* How the Game Works

The computer randomly chooses:

Snake (s)

Water (w)

Gun (g)

The user enters their choice.

The program compares both choices.

The result (Win / Lose / Tie) is displayed.

** Concepts Used:

Python functions

Conditional statements (if-elif-else)

Random module

User input

Return values

Game logic implementation
